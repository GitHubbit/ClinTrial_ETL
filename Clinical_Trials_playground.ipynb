Each daily set of flat files is made available for download until the end of the month. On the first of each month, a permanent copy of the flat files is created, archived and will remain available for download from this website.\n",

      "      Structure of Flat Files:  The files were created under a PC environment using UTF-8 encoding. Fields within each file are separated by the vertical bar character (“|”) commonly referred to as a “pipe”. A null or missing value for a field is delineated by consecutive “pipes” in the data stream. Records within each file are delimited by the line feed (LF) character. The first row of each file contains a delimited list of field names and the order of these names indicates the order of the data fields in the flat file. Most fields are character and are not enclosed within quotes, although single or double quotes may appear embedded within many of the descriptive fields.\n",

To prevent software from interpreting the embedded pipe as a delimiter, the entire string containing the pipe has been enclosed in double quotes. Also,line feed and paragraph break characters within fields, which might otherwise be interpreted as end of record characters, have been removed from the flat file database extracts.\n",

These relationships determine how data sets may be merged together.  There is one flat file for each database table indicated in the Schema Diagram. In addition, flat files containing meta data are available (data_definitions.txt, sanity_checks.txt, statistics.txt) are included. The Data Dictionary provides critical information about datasets and variables, including the expected number of records in a dataset, and the length of each variable.\n",
